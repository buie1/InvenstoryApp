Story:

Professor Ric is the owner of a bookstore. He is staring at his collection of books to sell to his students. He needs to take a picture of each book that he plans to sell. Each picture will be used for a thumbprint in his listing. He does not have much time to take a picture of each book, nor the knowledge of how to store the pictures in one location for future use. 

Professor Ric opens his InvenStory application and takes a picture of each book cover. The application uses these pictures as a thumbnail with corresponding entry spaces for the title, author, and number of copies. He also suggests a price for each book.

The application adds each book to a list, where he can easily see the thumbnail, title, author, quantity, and price of each book in his inventory. 

Tasks:

Task 1: Initiate Application
Once the application starts, a welcome screen should come up with options to take a picture or browse the current list of items. 

Task 2: Take a picture
Once the user selects the option to take a picture, the app connects to thte device's camera and allows the user to take a picture. Once a picture is taken, it is stored as a thumbnail on the device. 

Task 3: Create a New Element
Create a new item in the application that has multiple fields for book, title, author, quantity, and suggested price. The application checks to see if this item already exists and gives option to update quantity. 

Task 4: Receive and Store User Input Data
Create text fields next to the thumbnail for the Title and Author. The user is responsible for entering this data. 

Task 5: Add to list
The application stores each item in a list with a corresponding thumbnail. It is ready to add another item.
